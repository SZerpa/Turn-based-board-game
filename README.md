# Turn-based Board Game
Wizard of Oz turn-based board game with JavaScript and JQuery

# Project Requirements:
- Create an online game written in JavaScript in which 2 players play each turn to compete.
- Randomly generate the game map
- Weapons will be placed randomly and can
- The placement of the two players is also randomly on the map when the game loads
- For each turn, a player can move from one to three boxes (horizontally or vertically) before ending their turn. They obviously can not pass through obstacles directly
- If a player passes over a box containing a weapon, they leave their current weapon on site and replace it with the new one
- If players cross over adjacent squares (horizontally or vertically), a battle begins.
- Each player attacks in turn
- The damage depends on the player's weapon
- The player can choose to attack or defend against the next shot
- If the player chooses to defend themselves, they sustain 50% less damage than normal
- As soon as the life points of a player (initially 100) falls to 0, they lose. A message appears and the game is over.
